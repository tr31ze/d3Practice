# d3Practice

In the /basics folder you can find some simple d3 examples. 
All of them contains a single script tag in the head which includes the d3 library.
To run the examples just open every .html file separately.


The /dc-d3-mongoDB-node folder contains a tutorial.
To run the tutorial you need MongoDB  
---> Here is the dataset 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/iiu3tuhj3hrqv9w/sampledata.rar?dl=0 

with this command the data will be extracted to mongoDB 
mongoimport -d donorschoose -c projects --type csv --headerline --file 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Then run this command in the home folder to install the dependencies :  npm  install

And thats it, now just run 'npm start' and open the index.html file from the public folder.
